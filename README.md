# Histogram-of-an-images
## Aim
To obtain a histogram for finding the frequency of pixels in an Image with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255. Also write the code using OpenCV to perform histogram equalization.

## Software Required:
Anaconda - Python 3.7

## Algorithm:
### Step1:
Read the gray and color image using imread()

### Step2:
Print the image using imshow().



### Step3:
Use calcHist() function to mark the image in graph frequency for gray and color image.

### step4:
Use calcHist() function to mark the image in graph frequency for gray and color image.

### Step5:
The Histogram of gray scale image and color image is shown.


## Program:

## Output:
### Input Grayscale Image and Color Image

## Result: 
Thus the histogram for finding the frequency of pixels in an image with pixel values ranging from 0 to 255 is obtained. Also,histogram equalization is done for the gray scale image using OpenCV.
